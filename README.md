# Maze solver

Authors: Angel Villa, Qimeng Yu

Maze solver using BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths for weighted and unweighted mazes.

1. Run 'javac Maze.java'
2. Run 'java Maze.java [size]'
3. Compile and run MazeGraph.java to solve a maze. You will need to input
    a) maze#.txt weighted
       __or__
       maze#.txt unweighted
    b) quit
       __or__
       BFS
       __or__
       DFS
       __or__
       Dijkstra
    c) startVertexLabel endVertexLabel
       (e.g. 'ab db' as listed on VertexList, verify solution with maze4.txt file)
